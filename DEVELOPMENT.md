# Development Strategy & Branch Management

## 🌳 Branch Strategy

### Branch Purpose & Usage

#### `main` - Production Branch
**Purpose**: Stable, production-ready automation and environment tracking

**Contains**:
- ✅ Tested and working automation scripts
- ✅ Stable configuration files
- ✅ Production documentation
- ✅ Live dashboard integration
- ✅ Verified package intelligence

**Merge Policy**: Only merge thoroughly tested features from experiment branches

```bash
# Working on main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Deploy changes
./main/scripts/Termux-env/collect-env-data.sh
git add . && git commit -m "Update: production environment tracking"
git push  # Triggers GitHub Actions
```

---

#### `daily-experiments` - Learning Playground
**Purpose**: Daily homework, discovery, and learning experiments

**Contains**:
- 🧪 New tool discoveries
- 🧪 Configuration experiments
- 🧪 Learning exercises
- 🧪 Quick tests and prototypes
- 🧪 Documentation of discoveries

**Usage Pattern**: Free experimentation without production pressure

```bash
# Start daily learning session
git checkout daily-experiments
git pull origin daily-experiments

# Experiment freely
# Try new packages, test configurations, learn new commands

# Document discoveries
echo "## Today's Discovery: [Tool Name]" >> daily-discoveries.md
echo "- What it does: ..." >> daily-discoveries.md
echo "- How to use: ..." >> daily-discoveries.md

# Commit learning
git add . && git commit -m "Daily: discovered [what you learned]"
git push origin daily-experiments
```

---

#### `shell-experiments` - Shell Enhancement Lab
**Purpose**: Zsh/bash improvements, prompt development, and shell configurations

**Contains**:
- 🐚 Zsh prompt improvements
- 🐚 Bash vs Zsh comparisons
- 🐚 Shell function development
- 🐚 Completion enhancements
- 🐚 Terminal optimizations

**Usage Pattern**: Focused shell improvement work

```bash
# Shell development session
git checkout shell-experiments  
git pull origin shell-experiments

# Work on shell improvements
vim .zshrc
# Test new prompt configurations
# Develop shell functions

# Test thoroughly
source ~/.zshrc
# Verify all features work

# Commit improvements
git add . && git commit -m "Shell: improved git status prompt colors"
git push origin shell-experiments

# When ready for production
git checkout main
git merge shell-experiments
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Daily Learning Cycle

```bash
# Morning: Start experiment session
git checkout daily-experiments
git pull origin daily-experiments

# During day: Experiment and document
# - Try new packages: pkg install [package]
# - Test configurations
# - Document findings in markdown files

# Evening: Commit discoveries
git add . 
git commit -m "Daily $(date +%Y-%m-%d): [brief summary of discoveries]"
git push origin daily-experiments
```

### Feature Development Cycle

```bash
# 1. Start feature in appropriate branch
git checkout shell-experiments  # or daily-experiments

# 2. Develop and test
# Make changes
# Test thoroughly
# Document

# 3. Commit progress
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: [description]"
git push

# 4. When feature is ready
git checkout main
git merge shell-experiments  # Only when thoroughly tested

# 5. Update production
git push origin main  # Triggers automation
```

### Integration Workflow

```bash
# Merge valuable discoveries to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Review experiment branch for valuable changes
git log daily-experiments --oneline | head -10

# Selective merge or cherry-pick
git merge daily-experiments  # Full merge
# OR
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>  # Specific commits

# Test integration
./main/scripts/Termux-env/collect-env-data.sh

# Deploy to production
git push origin main
```

## 📝 Documentation Strategy

### Branch-Specific Documentation

#### Main Branch Documentation
- **README.md**: Complete project overview
- **ROADMAP.md**: Official development timeline
- **main/docs/**: Production documentation
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Official change history

#### Experiment Branch Documentation
- **daily-discoveries.md**: Daily learning log
- **experiment-log.md**: Detailed experiment records
- **tools-tested.md**: New tools and their evaluations
- **lessons-learned.md**: Key insights and gotchas

#### Shell Branch Documentation
- **shell-improvements.md**: Shell enhancement history
- **prompt-evolution.md**: Prompt development log
- **zsh-vs-bash.md**: Comparison notes
- **shell-functions.md**: Custom function documentation

### Documentation Integration
```bash
# In experiment branches: Document freely
echo "# Today I learned..." >> learning-log.md

# When merging to main: Update official docs
# Transfer valuable insights to main/docs/
# Update README.md with new features
# Update ROADMAP.md with completed items
```
