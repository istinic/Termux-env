# Daily Termux Homework - 2025-08-27

## Today's Focus: Wednesday - Package Intelligence

### Quick Wins (5 minutes)
- [x] Check your F-keys work: Open `htop`, press F1 (help), then 'q' to quit
  I read the F1 - Help and browse a litle in the Setup screen.
- [x] Test package intelligence: Run the new script:
  ```bash
  chmod +x ~/main/scripts/Termux-env/analyze-packages.sh
  ~/main/scripts/Termux-env/analyze-packages.sh
  ```
- [x] Quick git cleanup: `git add . && git commit -m "Daily: package analysis setup"`

### Learning Task (10 minutes)
**Today's Package Deep Dive: `tree`**

Since you mentioned getting lost in script details, let's use `tree` to visualize:

- [x] Try: `tree -L 2 ~/main` (see your project structure)
- [x] Try: `tree -a -L 1 ~/` (see hidden files in home) 
  looking at all dotfiles I realise maybe I don't need .bashrc, .profile?
- [x] Try: `tree --help | head -10` (see what options exist)
  this makes me confuzed I don't realy now how to use that info. wnever I tried on various executables not getting the expected results. good to have you by my side.
- [x] **Question**: How could `tree` help you understand your scripts better?
tree - a new function I need to learn. lets used it as often as posible.
### File to Explore Today (5 minutes)
Look at the package analysis you just generated:
```bash
cat ~/main/data/analytics/package-analysis.md | head -30
```

**Focus questions**:
- Which category has the most packages?
  Shell - terminal
- Do you recognize all the packages listed? - no
- Any packages you forgot you had installed? - 100 packages a lot to analyze and remember

### Practice Command (2 minutes)
Since you want to understand package sizes better:
```bash
# This will show actual sizes of installed packages
du -sh /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/* 2>/dev/null | sort -hr | head -5
```

### Keyboard Discovery Task (3 minutes)
You configured F-keys yesterday! Test them:

- [x] Open `htop`
- [x] Try F6 (sort by different columns)   I don't know most of those options
- [x] Try F2 (setup - but be careful, just look!)
- [x] Press 'q' to quit safely

**Question**: What other apps might benefit from F-keys?
If apps not preconfigured to use F-keys, then Fkey are useless
### Reflection Questions
After today's tasks:
1. Did the package analysis script help you understand your installed packages
better? - yes helped me to understand better the structure of termux.
2. Which package category surprised you most? - what way to surprise?
  having them grouped they doesn't look to be so many.
3. Are there packages you think you should remove?
it doesn't seams to be
those not used!?

### Homework Status
- [x] Quick wins completed
- [x] Learning task attempted (tree exploration)
- [x] File reading done (package analysis)
- [x] Practice command tried (package sizes)
- [x] Keyboard discovery completed
- [x] Reflection questions answered

## Tomorrow's Preview
Next session will focus on **git workflow optimization** - since you mentioned long `git diff` output being overwhelming.
