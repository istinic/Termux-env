Nice, running Oh My Zsh inside Termux is a good productivity boost 👌.
Here’s a list of useful plugins for your use case:


# 🔹 GitHub & Git

## git 
– built-in, adds tons of aliases (gst = git status, gco = git checkout, etc.).

## github 
– shortcuts for GitHub-specific actions like creating repos, opening PRs, cloning, etc.

## git-extras 
(external, install separately) – more aliases like git undo, git summary.

## gh 
(via GitHub CLI, not a zsh plugin but works well with completions).

---

# 🔹 Automation

## zsh-autosuggestions 
– suggests previous commands as you type.

## zsh-syntax-highlighting 
– highlights valid/invalid commands.

## auto-notify 
– notifies you when long-running commands finish.

## aliases 
– manage, search and create aliases on the fly.

## zsh-history-substring-search 
– fuzzy-search through command history.

## autojump / z 
– jump quickly to frequently visited directories.

---

# 🔹 TypeScript & React Dev

These aren’t language-specific plugins (since zsh doesn’t parse TS/React itself), but useful for workflow:

## npm 
– aliases for npm (ni = install, nr = run, etc.).

## yarn 
– aliases for Yarn if you use it.

## node 
– node helpers & version info.

## nvm 
(if you use Node Version Manager in Termux).

## fzf 
(install via pkg) + fzf-tab plugin – fuzzy file and command search, amazing for jumping between projects or running npm scripts interactively.

## command-not-found 
– suggests the package if you mistype a command (super useful in Termux).

---

# 🔹 Other Suggestions

## extract 
– quick extraction for tar, zip, gz, etc.

## sudo 
– allows repeating last command with sudo by typing sudo !!.

## colorize 
– pretty-prints JSON, logs, etc. (cat file.json | colorize json).

## history 
– better history navigation & deduplication.

## tmux 
– if you pair it with zsh, great for persistent sessions in Termux.

## docker 
– if you ever run Docker remotely (aliases for docker commands).

## pip 
– if you’re also doing Python stuff.

## web-search 
– quick Google/StackOverflow search from the terminal.

## z 
– quick directory jumping (learns your most visited paths).

---

👉 In Termux I’d suggest as a minimal core: git, github, npm, zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting, extract, aliases
8. fzf - not yet

## installing plugins

### Autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions

### Syntax highlighting
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting

# 🔹 Aliases
The most useful aliases and shortcuts you’ll get from those plugins in Termux + Oh My Zsh:


---

## 🔹 1. Git (plugin: git)

Command	Alias	What it does

git status	gst	Show status
git checkout branch	gco branch	Checkout branch
git checkout -b newbranch	gcb newbranch	Create + switch branch
git commit -m "msg"	gcmsg "msg"	Commit with message
git log --oneline --graph	glg	Pretty log
git diff	gd	Show diff
git pull	gl	Pull
git push	gp	Push
git merge branch	gm branch	Merge
git reset --hard HEAD	grhh	Hard reset
git fetch --all --prune	gfa	Fetch all



---

## 🔹 2. GitHub (plugin: github)

Command	Alias	What it does

git pull-request	ghpr	Open a pull request
git open	gho	Open repo in browser
git create-repo	ghcr	Create GitHub repo
git fork	ghf	Fork a repo
git browse	ghb	Open GitHub page


(requires gh GitHub CLI for some features)


---

## 🔹 3. NPM (plugin: npm)

Command	Alias	What it does

npm install	ni	Install deps
npm install package	ni package	Install package
npm run	nr	Run a script
npm run build	nrb	Run build script
npm outdated	no	Check outdated packages
npm publish	npub	Publish package



---

## 🔹 4. zsh-autosuggestions

As you type, previous matching commands appear in gray.

Press → (right arrow) to accept suggestion.



---

## 🔹 5. zsh-syntax-highlighting

Valid commands = green.

Invalid commands = red.

Options/flags get colored differently → instant feedback.

---

## 🔹 6. extract (plugin: extract)

Instead of remembering tar/zip commands:

x file.zip
x file.tar.gz
x file.rar

It auto-detects archive type & extracts.

---

## 🔹 7. aliases (plugin: aliases)

alias → list current aliases

alias-find git → search for aliases containing “git”

alias-list → show all aliases in nice format

alias-fix → correct mistakes if alias shadows a command

---

# 1. Personal aliases → ~/.profile

Example:

# ~/.profile

# Personal aliases
alias ll='ls -la --color=auto'
alias dev='npm run dev'
alias build='npm run build'
alias gs='git status'
alias gp='git push'

---

# 2. Custom PATH exports → ~/.bashrc

Example:

# ~/.bashrc

# Add custom bin directories
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="$HOME/scripts:$PATH"

---

# 3. Make Zsh load them

By default, Zsh does not read .bashrc or .profile — it only reads .zshrc.
So, we “bridge” them by sourcing inside ~/.zshrc:

# ~/.zshrc

# Load Oh My Zsh
export ZSH="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"

plugins=(
  git
  github
  npm
  zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
  extract
  aliases
)

source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

# ✅ Load your own configs
[ -f ~/.profile ] && source ~/.profile
[ -f ~/.bashrc ] && source ~/.bashrc


---

4. Reload after changes

source ~/.zshrc


---

✅ Result

Your aliases live in .profile (easy to back up, portable).

Your PATHs and environment live in .bashrc.

Zsh will automatically load both when it starts.
