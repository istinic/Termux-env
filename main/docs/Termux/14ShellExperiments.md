# Major changes
Let's assess and document these changes systematically. Current Termux State Assessment
First, let's capture what you actually have now:
## Check current shell and configuration
echo $SHELL
ls -la ~/.zshrc ~/.bashrc ~/.profile 2>/dev/null || echo "Files not found"

## Check git submodules
git submodule status

## Check current Termux configuration
ls -la ~/.termux/

## Check what shell plugins are actually working
ls -la ~/.oh-my-zsh/ 2>/dev/null || echo "OhMyZsh not installed"
# Submodule Strategy Decision
Regarding git submodules for shell plugins:
Against submodules for shell plugins:
Shell plugins update frequently with breaking changes
You lose control over when updates happen
Debugging becomes harder when plugins auto-update
Most shell configurations work better with manual plugin management
Better approach:

## Manual installation gives you control
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ~/.zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting ~/.zsh/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting

## Add to .zshrc manually:
source ~/.zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
source ~/.zsh/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zshDocumentation Update StrategyLet's create a systematic update:# Create branch for current changes documentation
git checkout -b update-termux-shell-config

## Create new documentation file
nano main/docs/Termux/12TermuxShellExperiments.md
Content for this file:
#### Termux Shell Configuration Experiments

#### Timeline of Changes

##### OhMyZsh Attempt (Removed)
- **Issue**: F-key conflicts with Termux
- **Lesson**: OhMyZsh assumes desktop terminal behavior
- **Status**: Removed, not suitable for Termux

##### Starship Prompt Attempt (Removed)  
- **Issue**: [Document specific issues you encountered]
- **Status**: Removed

##### Current Configuration
- **Shell**: Zsh with custom configuration
- **Plugins**: zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting
- **Installation Method**: [Submodules or manual?]
- **Extra Keys**: Partially configured
- **Custom Prompt**: In progress

#### Lessons Learned

##### Termux-Specific Considerations
- Desktop shell frameworks often conflict with mobile terminal constraints
- F-key mappings behave differently in Termux
- Simpler configurations work better than complex frameworks

##### Recommended Approach
- Use basic Zsh with minimal plugins
- Manual plugin management over submodules
- Custom prompt instead of complex prompt frameworks
- Roadmap Updates Needed
- Current roadmap needs these additions: New Milestone 3.4: Shell Environment Optimization
    Document shell configuration experiments
    Establish stable Zsh configuration
    Create Termux-specific best practices
  New Milestone 3.5: Daily Learning System
    Implement homework system
    Create learning workflow
    Establish practice routines
    Immediate Actions Required

- Document current state: What's actually installed and working now?
  Branch strategy: Yes, create homework branch:
  git checkout -b homework-system
- Clean up submodules: Decide whether to keep them or switch to manual installation
- Update documentation: Create accurate current-state documentation

Let's start with documenting your actual current state. Run those initial commands above and share the output so we can document what you actually have now, rather than what was attempted and removed.
