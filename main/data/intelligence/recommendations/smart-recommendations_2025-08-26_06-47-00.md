pkg install ncdu         # Disk usage analyzer
```

### Workflow-Specific Recommendations

#### Web Development
If you do web development:
```bash
pkg install nodejs-lts   # Long-term support Node.js
npm install -g live-server
npm install -g nodemon
```

#### System Administration
For server management:
```bash
pkg install nmap         # Network scanning
pkg install netcat       # Network debugging
pkg install rsync        # File synchronization
```

#### Data Analysis
For data work:
```bash
pkg install sqlite       # Lightweight database
pkg install python       # Data analysis libraries
pip install pandas numpy jupyter
```

## Learning Prioritization

### Week 1-2: Foundation
1. **File System Navigation**
   ```bash
   ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, rmdir
   cp, mv, rm, chmod, chown
   ```

2. **Basic Text Editing**
   ```bash
   nano basics: Ctrl+X, Ctrl+O, Ctrl+K
   # OR vim basics: i, :w, :q, :wq
   ```

3. **Package Management**
   ```bash
   pkg update
   pkg search <name>
   pkg install <name>
   pkg show <name>
   ```

### Week 3-4: Development Tools
1. **Git Fundamentals**
   ```bash
   git init, add, commit, push, pull
   git branch, checkout, merge
   git status, log, diff
   ```

2. **SSH and Remote Access**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519
   ssh user@host
   scp, rsync basics
   ```

### Month 2: Advanced Usage
1. **Shell Scripting**
2. **Process Management**
3. **Network Tools**
4. **Automation Workflows**

## Common Termux Pitfalls to Avoid

### Package Management
- ❌ Don't use `sudo` - Termux doesn't need it
- ❌ Don't install packages with `apt` - use `pkg`
- ✅ Always run `pkg update` before `pkg install`

### File Permissions
- ❌ Don't try to access `/system` - Android restriction
- ❌ Don't expect traditional Linux filesystem layout
- ✅ Use `termux-setup-storage` for Android file access

### Development Setup
- ❌ Don't install conflicting package managers
- ❌ Don't ignore virtual environments for Python/Node
- ✅ Use version managers when available
